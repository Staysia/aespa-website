            <h2>Compositions</h2>
            <p>"Whiplash" is an EDM dance song with intense and fast basslines and a house rhythm, and since it is the first techno song to challenge themselves since their debut, you can see the boundless musical growth of aespa as they constantly challenge themselves.</p>
            <p>"Kill It" is a hip-hop dance track with a catchy signature synthesizer sound and impressive vocals. The track sends a warning message to those who make unfounded criticism through powerful rap and vocals. DJ and producer IMLAY from ScreaM Records took part in the creation and arrangement of the track.</p>
            <p>"Flights, To Feelings" is an attractive R&B track with a vintage but mysterious sound and dreamy vocal harmony. The lyrics convey positive messages about how to let go of negative feelings, live freely and enjoy life. This song will allow listeners to experience the new vocal charm of aespa, which they have not tried before.</p>
            <p>"Pink Hoodie" is a hip—hop dance track featuring an original synthesizer sound and energetic bass. The lyrics deftly convey the idea of accepting yourself for who you are and self-confidence.</p>
            <p>"Flowers" is an alternative R&B song featuring an exquisite guitar riff. In the text, the feeling of falling in love is figuratively conveyed through flowers, and the dreamy vocals are harmoniously intertwined with the sound, fully conveying the emotional depth of the song.</p>
            <p>"Just Another Girl" is a pop-rock song that attracts attention with its rough guitar sound and refreshing vocals. The lyrics carry a warning message, easily parting with a betrayed lover, while creating a playful and refreshing atmosphere.</p>
